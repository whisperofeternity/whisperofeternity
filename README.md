# About me

**whisperofeternity/whisperofeternity** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on test projects to develop my skills and understanding of embedded engineering by itself
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: either here or if you know me in person, you also might know ways to contact me
- âš¡ Fun(?) fact: we live breathing oxygen which is used in oxidation and since burning is really intense oxidation, our life is basically bonfire. We decide how bright we burn, but the brighter the fire the less it lasts. We should value not our "brightness" but how many people could get "warmth" of our life.
